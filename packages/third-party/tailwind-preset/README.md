# @lynx-js/tailwind-preset

A [Tailwind CSS preset](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/presets) optimized for Lynx compatibility, providing modified utilities and removing unsupported CSS features.

## Why use it?

Currently, Lynx does not support all web-standard CSS features like browsers do, so some CSS generated by tailwindcss will not work in Lynx.

For example:

- `underline` will generate `text-decoration-line: underline;`, but Lynx does not support `text-decoration-line`, so we will replace it with `text-decoration: underline;`, [which is supported in Lynx](https://lynxjs.org/api/css/properties/text-decoration.html#text-decoration-line).
- `cursor-pointer` will generate `cursor: pointer;`, but Lynx does not support `cursor`, so we will remove support for `cursor-pointer`, etc.

:warning: This preset is still unstable, use with caution. If you find any tailwindcss feature that does not work properly and should be supported, please open an issue.

## Usage

In your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
import preset from '@lynx-js/tailwind-preset';

export default {
  presets: [
    preset,
  ],
};
```
