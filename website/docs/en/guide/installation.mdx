import { PackageManagerTabs } from "@theme";

# Installation

System Requirements:

- [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en) or later.
  - Requires Node.js 18.19 when using TypeScript as configuration.

## Creating a New Project using Create Rspeedy \{#create-rspeedy}

We recommend starting a new Rspeedy app using [`create-rspeedy`](https://npmjs.org/package/create-rspeedy),
which sets up everything automatically for you. To create a project, run:

<PackageManagerTabs command="create rspeedy@latest" />

After the prompts, `create-rspeedy` will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

## Enable Type Checking (optional)

### Using `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`

The [`@rsbuild/plugin-type-check`](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rsbuild-plugin-type-check) integrates
with [`fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/TypeStrong/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin).
It can be directly used in Rspeedy!

Begin by installing the plugin using your preferred package management tool:

<PackageManagerTabs command="install -D @rsbuild/plugin-type-check" />

Next, incorporate the plugin into your configuration file by adding it to the relevant section:

```ts title=lynx.config.ts {3,11}
import { defineConfig } from "@lynx-js/rspeedy";
import { pluginReactLynx } from "@lynx-js/react-rsbuild-plugin";
import { pluginTypeCheck } from "@rsbuild/plugin-type-check";

export default defineConfig({
  source: {
    entry: "src/index.jsx",
  },
  plugins: [pluginReactLynx(), pluginTypeCheck()],
});
```

Now, both your `npm run dev` and `npm run build` will build the projects **with type checking**!

:::info The behavior of the plugin differs in the development and production builds

- During development builds, type errors do not block the build process. They are only logged in the terminal.
- During production builds, type errors cause the build to fail in order to ensure the stability of the production code.

For more detailed options, please refer to [`@rsbuild/plugin-type-check`](https://github.com/rspack-contrib/rsbuild-plugin-type-check).
:::

### Using `tsc`

Enabling type checking in ReactLynx is also possible.
This can be achieved by simply adding a `typecheck` script in the `package.json` file:

```json title=package.json {5}
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "rspeedy dev",
    "build": "rspeedy build",
    "typecheck": "tsc --build"
  }
}
```

Then, run `npm run typecheck` to check the TypeScript files.
