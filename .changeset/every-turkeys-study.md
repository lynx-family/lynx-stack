Bundle Rspeedy with Rslib for faster start-up times.

This would be a **BREAKING CHANGE** for using [global version of Rspeedy](https://lynxjs.org/rspeedy/cli#using-the-global-rspeedy-version).

Please ensure that you update your globally installed version of Rspeedy:

```bash
npm install --global @lynx-js/rspeedy@latest
```
