"upgrade-rspeedy": patch

Add Web platform packages.

This update introduces support for upgrading web platform packages:

- `@lynx-js/web-core`: Core web platform functionality
- `@lynx-js/web-elements`: Web elements and components

Usage:

```bash
npx upgrade-rspeedy
```

This command will now handle the upgrade process for both web platform packages automatically.
