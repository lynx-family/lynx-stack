"@lynx-js/preact-devtools": patch
---

Supports Preact Devtools for ReactLynx. Now you can enable it by adding the following import to **the first** line in your whole app.

```bash
import '@lynx-js/preact-devtools'
```

And then you can inspect your App with the "Preact Devtools" Panel in [LynxDevtool](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-devtool).
